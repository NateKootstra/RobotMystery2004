Robot Mystery was a game created by FIRST Robotics team 772 in 2004. Here is the description found on the CD cover:



"One mission, one hope, one problem.

The Sabre Robotics team's plans take a turn for the worse when their robot ends up missing one hour before shipping

Play as Ludwik Sobiesiak (team leader) and search through Sandwich Secondary High School in search of clues that will ultimately reveal the chilling truth about who's really behind this crime!"
